Data Integration
# For Spectacle Input
binary.py - given multiple files (one per chromosome), adds additional feature (eRNA) 
binary_p300.py - same as binary.py but adds additional feature of p300 overlap

# For SVM/Logit Input
add_feature_v1.ipynb - given multiple files (one per chromosome), input of adds additional feature (p300) with output in one file for all chromosomes
add_feature_v2.ipynb - given one file (containing all chromosomes), adds additional feature (tfbs) with output in one file for all chromosomes

Data Integration + Analysis 
exp.R - integrate enhancer prediction from histone marks and conduct exploratory analysis of eRNA data
tss.ipynb - finds distances to nearest transcription start site
tss.R - plots output of tss.ipynb
p300.ipynb - finds overlap with p300 for each state
p300.R - plots output of p300.ipynb


Machine Learning Models
svm_logit.ipynb - runs SVM and logistic regression
